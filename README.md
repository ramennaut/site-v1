This is the repository for my [digital space](https://www.lenz.wiki/) which is hosted on Github Pages and built using Jekyll. The site is a *very public* brain dump, since microblogs don’t seem to do the trick anymore. This space serves as a canvas for my thoughts, learnings, and experiments in a world cluttered with fleeting content -- a project born out of the need for a platform where chaos meets order.

The site features a [/now](https://www.lenz.wiki/now/), [/next](https://www.lenz.wiki/next/), and [/archive](https://www.lenz.wiki/archive/) page for present, future, and past works, respectively. It also features a matcha-like color scheme because I like matcha. Highlights, preformatted code blocks, and markdown tables adhere to this color scheme.

## Getting Started
You can go to https://www.lenz.wiki to access the wesbite; but if you ever want to run the website locally, feel free to follow the steps below.

1. **Clone the repository.**
    Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux) and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramennaut/ramennaut.github.io.git
    ```
    This command downloads the project files to a folder named `ramennaut.github.io` in your current directory.
2. **Navigate to the project directory.**
    Change your current working directory to the project folder you just cloned. Run:
    ```bash
    cd ramennaut.github.io
    ```
3. **Install Jekyll and other dependencies.**
    Before proceeding, ensure you have Ruby and Bundler installed on your system. If you haven't, visit the official [Ruby download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and the [Bundler documentation](https://bundler.io/) for installation instructions. Once Ruby and Bundler are set up, install the Jekyll site dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
4. **Serve the site locally.**
    To view your site on a local web server, execute:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    This command builds your site and hosts it locally, allowing you to view and test your site in a browser.
5. **Access the site in a web browser:**
    After the site builds, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:4000 to see your site in action. You should now be viewing your local version of the site.

If you make any changes to the site's source files, Jekyll will automatically rebuild the site, allowing you to see the updates by refreshing your browser.

## Future developments

I am excited about the future of this code base, with plans to further develop and separate the theme and color scheme for broader use, including potential integration with Obsidian. This will allow for more personalized and efficient user experiences. If you're interested in contributing or want to stay updated on these developments, feel free to star the repository. More updates will be posted in the future, and I'm always open to collaboration and feedback.
